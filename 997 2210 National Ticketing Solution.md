New Zealanders will be able to use contactless debit card payment and other services like Apple Pay to pay for public transport fares under a new National Ticketing Solution (NTS) announced on Friday.

The single payment system will begin being rolled out in Canterbury in 2024 and will be available in all other participating council areas by 2026.
